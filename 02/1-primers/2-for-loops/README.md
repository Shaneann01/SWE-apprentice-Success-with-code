# `for` Loops

- A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
- A `for` loop will loop through a block of code for a set number of times. 
- Anything that can be accomplished with a `for` loop can also be done with a `while` loop, but each loop has different cases where they are most useful.

## `for` Loops Example

Suppose you wanted to count up from 1 to 7, you could write the following `for` loop:

```javascript
for(let i = 1; i <= 7; i++){
    console.log(`The value of i is ${i}`)
}
```

The console for this would print:
```shell
The value of i is 1
The value of i is 2
The value of i is 3
The value of i is 4
The value of i is 5
The value of i is 6
The value of i is 7
```
