# Logical Operators:

Logical operators are used to combine two or more comparison operators.
JavaScript has three logical operators: `&&`, `||`, and `!`.

For example:

```js
let age = 25;
console.log(age > 20 && age < 30); // true
console.log(age > 20 || age < 30); // true
console.log(!(age > 20)); // false
```
