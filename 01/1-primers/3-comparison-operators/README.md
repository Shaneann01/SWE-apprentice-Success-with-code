# Comparison Operators:

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean value (true or false).
JavaScript has several comparison operators: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `===`, `!=`, and `!==`.

For example:

```js
let age = 25;
console.log(age > 20); // true
console.log(age < 30); // true
console.log(age === 25); // true
console.log(age !== 30); // true
console.log(age === 30); // false
console.log(age !== 25); // false
```
