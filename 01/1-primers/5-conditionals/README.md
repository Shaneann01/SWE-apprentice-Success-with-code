# Writing Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

The `if` statement is one way to write conditional logic in JavaScript.

For example:

```js
let age = 25;
if (age > 20) {
  console.log("You are older than 20.");
} else {
  console.log("You are 20 or younger.");
}
```
