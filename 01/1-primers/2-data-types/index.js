// 1. Declare a variable named favoriteVegetable and assign it the value of your favorite vegetable as a string. (Psst: No one likes vegetables, so make it `undefined`!)

// 2. Declare a variable named livingDinosaur and assign it the value of `null`.  Of course, there are no living dinosaurs anymore!

// 3. Declare a variable named favoriteCountry and assign it the value of your favorite country as a string.

// 4. Declare a variable named birthYear and assign it the value of your birth year as a number.

// 5. Declare a variable named isCool and assign it the value of `true` or `false`. But I'm sure it will be `true`!
