# Variables and Constants

## Variable Declaration and Assignment:

- Variables are used to store data in a program. They are like containers that hold a value.
- In order to create a variable, you need to declare it by specifying its name and the data type it will hold. For example:
`let name = "John";`
- Assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to the variable. 

For example:
```js
let age = 25;
let name = "John";
```

## `const` vs. `let`:

`const` and `let` are used to declare variables in JavaScript.
The main difference between them is that a variable declared with `const` cannot be reassigned, while a variable declared with `let` can be reassigned.
For example:
```js
const a = 3;
a = 4; // This will throw an error because 'a' is a constant and can't be reassigned

let b = 3;
b = 4; // This is okay because 'b' is a let variable and can be reassigned
```
