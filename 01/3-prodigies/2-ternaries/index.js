// define an arrow function, `isFamous`, that takes in the number of followers on social media, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the person is considered "famous". If the person has more than 100,000 followers, they are considered famous, otherwise they are not.  USE THE TERNARY OPERATOR (the tests won't catch this, but practice it, as that's what we learned ðŸ˜Š)
/* 
Examples:
isFamous(50000) should return false
isFamous(150000) should return true
 */

// define an arrow function, `isHot`, that takes in a temperature (in Celsius), and returns a string indicating whether or not the weather is considered "hot". If the temperature is above 30 degrees, it is hot, otherwise it is not. USE THE TERNARY OPERATOR
/* 
Examples:
isHot(25) should return `not hot`
isHot(35) should return `hot`
 */
