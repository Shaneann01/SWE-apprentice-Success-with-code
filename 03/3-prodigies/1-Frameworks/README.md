# CSS Frameworks
- Rather than needing to create CSS from scratch, CSS frameworks are prepared and ready-to-use CSS libraries that come with many built-in designs.
- Frameworks are comprised of several pre-written CSS stylesheets ready to use by developers. 
- Most frameworks function by allowing you to quickly style through the use of already defined class names. For example, a button in Bootstrap uses the classes `btn btn-primary` to style the button and give it a blue color:
    ```html
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Click Me!</button>
    ```
- Two common CSS Frameworks are:
    - Bootstrap
    - Tailwind

**TASK**: Build and design a page using either the Bootstrap or Tailwind Framework.

- Watch [Learn Bootstrap in 20 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eow125xV5-c) and build the page with the tutorial.

    - You can use the [Tailwind CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), but this may be well beyond your current knowledge as it requires some foundational understanding of node modules.
