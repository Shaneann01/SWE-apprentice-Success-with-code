# Media Queries
- When designing websites, we need to consider all the different types of browsers that our users my access from (phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, etc)
- Media queries allow us to specify different CSS rulesets that will be applied based on the size of the screen.
- The `@media` rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices.

## `@media` Example

We have decided to style our page with a `yellow` background.
`style.css`
```css
body {
    background-color: yellow;
}
```

This is nice, but we want a `lightblue` background only when the screen is smaller than `600px`. A `@media` rule can help to add this in.

`style.css`
```css
body {
    background-color: yellow;s
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 600px){
    body {
        background-color: lightblue;
    }
}
```

This now will color the `body` yellow on screens that are ***larger*** than 600px and will color the `body` lightblue on screens smaller than 600px.
