# SQL Functions
SQL Functions are pre-written blocks of code that can be used to perform specific operations within SQL. They can greatly simplify your code and make it more reusable and efficient.

Here's an example of creating a function in SQL to calculate the average age of a group of superheroes:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION average_age(group_name VARCHAR(255))
RETURNS NUMERIC
BEGIN
    DECLARE avg_age NUMERIC;
    SELECT AVG(age) INTO avg_age
    FROM superheroes
    WHERE name = group_name;
    RETURN avg_age;
END;
```
In this example, we've created a function called `average_age` that takes in a group name and returns the average age of all superheroes in that group. This function can then be used in a query like this:

```sql
SELECT name, average_age(name)
FROM superheroes;
```
As you can see, the use of a function has greatly simplified the query. By encapsulating the logic behind the calculation into a function, we can now use it in multiple places without having to repeat the calculation over and over again. This helps to make our code more readable and maintainable.

It's worth noting that functions can also accept input parameters and can return multiple values, making them a very powerful tool for writing complex, reusable SQL code.
