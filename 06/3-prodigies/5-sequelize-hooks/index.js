/* 

You are creating a magical database of Patronuses for the Wizarding World. A Patronus is a magical guardian that protects a wizard from harm. Each Patronus has a name and an animal that represents it.

To make the database more user-friendly, you want to ensure that the names of the Patronuses are capitalized properly. However, you realize that it would be a tedious task to capitalize the names of all Patronuses manually. You decide to use a Sequelize beforeCreate hook that capitalizes the first letter of the name property before it is saved to the database.

ðŸ‘‰ Your task: Define a beforeCreate hook on the Patronus model that capitalizes the first letter of the name property before it is saved to the database.
