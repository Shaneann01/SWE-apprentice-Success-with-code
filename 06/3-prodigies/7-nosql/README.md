# NoSQL
A NoSQL database, such as MongoDB, is different from a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) like SQL in several key ways.

1. Data Structure: NoSQL databases use a flexible and dynamic data structure, known as a document-based data structure, which allows for unstructured and semi-structured data to be stored and retrieved easily. On the other hand, RDBMS uses a fixed, structured data model, where data is stored in tables and relationships between tables are established through keys.

2. Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to be highly scalable and can handle large amounts of unstructured data, making them suitable for big data applications. RDBMS, on the other hand, may struggle with scalability and may require complex workarounds to handle large amounts of data.

3. Performance: NoSQL databases typically offer better performance compared to RDBMS, as they are optimized for high read and write operations. RDBMS may face performance issues when dealing with large amounts of data, as the data must be read from multiple tables and joined together.

4. Querying: Querying data in NoSQL databases is typically more straightforward and less complex than in RDBMS, as the data is stored in a more flexible and dynamic structure. In RDBMS, complex queries are often necessary to retrieve data from multiple tables, and joins can become slow and unwieldy.

In conclusion, the choice between NoSQL and RDBMS depends on the specific use case and requirements of the application. NoSQL is best suited for big data, high-performance, and scalability, while RDBMS is best suited for complex and structured data relationships.

## Challenge
We have only learned SQL up until this point. Our challenge to you is to go out there, pick a NoSQL database, and learn a bit about it, how to use it, and **bonus points:** Try it out in a project! ðŸ¤¯ We recommend MongoDB, but there are many others, including Firebase, CouchDB, and DynamoDB.  You can choose any NoSQL database you like. Once you've learned the basics, come back and try to answer the following questions:
- What is the name of the NoSQL database you chose?
- How does it differ from SQL?
- What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of using NoSQL?
- What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of using SQL?
- What is the use case for each?
