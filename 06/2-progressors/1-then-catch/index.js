import fetch from "node-fetch";

/* 
These exercises are optional, since we have not yet covered the fetch() API. If you would like to run the tests, remove the `.skip` from the `describe` blocks in the test file.

Create a function called `fetchUser` that takes a user ID as a parameter and makes an HTTP request to an external API to retrieve user information. The API endpoint is https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/, and you should append the user ID to the end of the URL to make the request. The function should return a Promise that resolves to an object containing the user's name and email. If the user is not found, the Promise should reject with an error message.

Additionally, create a function called `fetchUsers` that takes an array of user IDs as a parameter and returns a Promise that resolves to an array of objects containing the name and email of each user.

You should use `async` functions and `await` syntax to make the requests.
