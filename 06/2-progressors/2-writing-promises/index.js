/* 

Write a function, `alligatorPromise` that takes no parameters and returns a Promise.

The function should generate a random integer between 1 and 4, to be used in the Promise that is returned.

The Promise should...
- Resolve with the string "Alligator!" after 200 ms.
- However, if the random time is divisible by 2, the Promise should reject with the error "Oh no, it's a crocodile!" instead.

/* 

Write a function `averageNumbers` that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a Promise.

The Promise should... 
- Resolve with the average of the numbers in the array. 
- However, if the array contains any negative numbers, the Promise should reject with the error message "Negative numbers are not allowed".
