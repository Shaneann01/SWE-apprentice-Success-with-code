# SQL `UPDATE` Statement
The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table in SQL. For example, to increase the age of all superheroes by 5 years:
```sql
UPDATE superheroes
SET age = age + 5;
```
This statement will update all rows in the `superheroes` table, increasing the value of the `age` column by 5.

## Updating Specific Rows
You can also specify conditions to only update specific rows. For example, to increase the age of all superheroes named 'Batman' by 5 years:
```sql
UPDATE superheroes
SET age = age + 5
WHERE name = 'Batman';
```
This statement will only update the rows in the `superheroes` table where the `name` is 'Batman', increasing the value of the `age` column by 5 for those rows.
