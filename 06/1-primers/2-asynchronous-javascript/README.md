# Asynchronous JavaScript
Asynchronous code is a way of executing code in a non-blocking manner in JavaScript, meaning that it doesn't halt the execution of the rest of the code while it's waiting for a response.

In JavaScript, asynchronous code can be achieved using functions such as `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `Promise` objects, among others.

Here's a code example that demonstrates how asynchronous code works in JavaScript using `setTimeout`:
```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This is a message from the future!");
}, 1000);

console.log("End");
```
When the code is executed, it will first log `"Start"` to the console, then it will wait for 1000 milliseconds (1 second) and log `"This is a message from the future!"`, and finally log `"End"`.

In this example, you can see that the `setTimeout` function is set to run after 1000 milliseconds, which allows the rest of the code to continue executing without waiting for the function to complete. This is why `"End"` is logged to the console before the `setTimeout` function logs its message.

This is a simple example, but it demonstrates the basic concept of asynchronous code in JavaScript.
