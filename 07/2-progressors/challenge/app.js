Pagination: The Royal Court is managing a large number of noble houses and they need an application that can handle pagination of the noble houses in a clean and efficient way. They have tasked you with refactoring this api route to paginate the noble houses based on query parameters `page` and `pageSize`. 

Considerations:
- If there are no query params passed in, the default values should be `page=1` and `pageSize=10`.
- Return the data in this format: `{ page, pageSize, totalPages, nobleHouses }` where 
  - `page` is the current page number
  - `pageSize` is the number of noble houses per page
  - `nobleHouses` is the resulting array of noble houses for the given page
  - `totalPages` is the total number of pages when dividing the total number of noble houses by the page size.

Filtering and Sorting: The Royal Court wants to be able to find like-minded nobles quickly and easily. They have asked you to refactor this API route so that it that can filter and sort the houses based on query parameters `sigil` and `words`.

- Results should be returned even if the parameters are found within the `sigil` or `words` fields, not only if they are an exact match. (Hint: Array.prototype.includes() will be very helpful here)
