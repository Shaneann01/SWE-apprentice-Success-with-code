# Express CRUD
In a typical web application, we need to perform four basic operations on data: create new records, read existing records, update existing records, and delete existing records. These operations are often referred to as CRUD operations.

Express provides four HTTP methods that correspond to these CRUD operations: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`. Here's a brief overview of what these methods do:

- `GET`: retrieves an existing resource (i.e. read operation)
- `POST`: creates a new resource (i.e. create operation)
- `PUT`: updates an existing resource (i.e. update operation)
- `DELETE`: deletes an existing resource (i.e. delete operation)

In the next few modules, we'll see how we can use these methods in our `Superhero` example.
