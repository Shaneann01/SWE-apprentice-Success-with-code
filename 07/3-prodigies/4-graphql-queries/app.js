/* 
The robots in the rock band want to be able to find out which of their songs are the most popular among their fans. They want you to write a GraphQL query that retrieves the top n most popular songs, where n is a variable that can be passed in as an argument.

Write a GraphQL query that retrieves the top n most popular songs, along with their play count and the name of the album they are from.

You can assume that there is already a resolver function that will return an array of Song objects with the correct data.
