/* 
Challenge: Implement Basic Auth Middleware
Our rock band already has an express app.  The website has a secret page that only authorized users should be able to access. The authorized users are stored in the `users` array.

Challenge: 
- Create a basicAuth middleware that checks if the username and password match one of the users in the array. If the credentials don't match, return a 401 Unauthorized status code.
- You may use the `basic-auth` package (imported above) or write your own middleware.
