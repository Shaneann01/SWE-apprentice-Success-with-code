Comically Polymorphic Farm Animals
Prompt
You have been tasked with building a farm animal simulator. The farm has 3 types of animals: pigs, cows, and chickens. Each type of animal can make a unique noise:

- Pigs oink
- Cows moo
- Chickens cluck

Create a base `Animal` class with a makeNoise method that returns the animal's noise. Then, create a `Pig`, `Cow`, and `Chicken` class that inherit from the `Animal` class and each implements the `makeNoise` method to return their respective noises.
