# Object Oriented Analysis and Design

## Goal of OOAD:

Programming Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) is a software development approach that uses objects and classes to represent real-world concepts and entities. The aim of OOAD is to create software that can be easily maintained and modified to meet changing requirements. This approach is based on the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and aims to provide a structured and organized method for designing software systems.

## Object-Oriented Analysis:
OOAD starts with a deep understanding of the problem domain and its requirements. The first step is to identify the objects that exist in the problem domain and their relationships. This process is known as object modeling and is used to create a conceptual model of the software system. The model is then used to create a design that outlines the objects and their relationships, as well as the behavior of each object.

## Object-Oriented Design:
The design phase of OOAD is crucial, as it determines the structure and organization of the software system. The objects and classes are designed to encapsulate the data and behavior of the system, making it easier to manage and maintain. The design should also be flexible enough to accommodate changes in the requirements of the system.

## Class Diagrams
Class diagrams are a fundamental part of object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) and are used to represent the objects and classes in a software system. They provide a visual representation of the objects and their relationships, making it easier to understand the structure of the system. Class diagrams are an essential tool for OOAD and are used throughout the software development process. They provide a visual representation of the objects and their relationships, making it easier to understand and communicate the structure of the software system.

## Use Case Diagrams
Use case diagrams are a visual representation of the functionality provided by a software system. They show the interactions between the system and its users, and are used to capture the requirements of a system from the user's perspective. To create a use case diagram, you need to identify the actors, who represent the users of the system, and the use cases, which represent the functionalities provided by the system. Connect the actors to the use cases to show their interactions and relationships. Use case diagrams help to identify the functional requirements of a system, making it easier to design and implement the software.
