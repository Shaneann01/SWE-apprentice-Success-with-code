# Test Driven Development (TDD)
**Note: This topic's challenge is to write tests for the functions in the modules in this directory!**

## TDD
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process where you write tests before writing the actual implementation. The idea is to write tests that describe how the code should behave, then write the code to make the tests pass. This process helps ensure that your code is well-designed, testable, and that you have a suite of automated tests that can catch any regressions as you continue to make changes to your code.

In JavaScript, you can write unit tests using various testing frameworks. One of the most popular testing frameworks is Jest.

```js
// A simple function to be tested
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// The test for the add function
test("adds two numbers", () => {
  const result = add(1, 2);
  expect(result).toBe(3);
});
```
In this example, the `add` function is a simple function that adds two numbers. The `test` function is provided by Jest and it's used to write a test for the `add` function. The first argument to the `test` function is a string that describes what the test does. The second argument is a callback function that contains the actual test.

Inside the test, we call the `add` function with `1` and `2` as arguments and assign the result to a variable named `result`. Then we use the expect function provided by Jest to make an assertion about the result. The `toBe` function is a matcher that checks if the actual value is equal to the expected value.

In TDD, you would start by writing a failing test, then write the implementation to make the test pass, then repeat the process for the next feature. Jest provides a lot of helpful features for writing tests, such as automatic test discovery, test parallelization, and snapshot testing.

This is just a basic example, but it demonstrates the basic principles of TDD and writing unit tests in JavaScript using Jest. By following these principles, you can write high-quality code that is well-tested and maintainable.
