# Pizza Components üçï

**TASK**: You have been tasked with creating a webpage for the local pizza shop. Luckily, you know some React and there are already some components built for you.

## What To Do

1. Import and render the `NavBar` component in `App.js`.
2. Import and render the `Pizza` component below the `Navbar` in `App.js`. Change the `Pizza` component to contain your name.
3. Import and render the `Menu` component below the `Pizza` component in `App.js`.
4. It appears all the different pizzas (Peperoni, MeatLover, and Veggie) are just rendering a slice of plain pizza. Update the `Peperoni`, `MeatLover`, and `Veggie` components so that they:
    - Include the correct title
    - Include the correct image. All images are stored in the `images` folder.
    - Each slice a proper description.
5. The `Hawaiian` slice is missing even though it has been created. Render the `Hawaiian` component inside the `Menu` component.
6. The `Bbq` component is completely empty. Create a component that renders a card for a slice of Bbq pizza that costs $1.00. An image of Bbq pizza can be found in the images folder.
7. **STRETCH**: Create a Footer component in a file called `Footer.js`. This component will come after the `Menu` component in `App.js` and contain the store address and phone number. The store address is 555 Time Square, NY, NY 10000 and the phone number is (212) 555 5555.
