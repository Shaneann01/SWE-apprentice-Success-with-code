# SWE Apprentice Success Guide
Elevating Software Engineering Skills through Additional Practice and Assistance

Welcome to the Apprentice Success Guide for Software Engineering (SWE)!

This resource is designed to provide additional support and practice for apprentices who are enrolled in a SWE course. Each weekly topic will include content for multiple groups. For example, if you are with the...

1. üîç Primers - Great content if you **require additional support** to fully grasp the material - we provide additional explanations and examples to help you better understand the material.
2. üöÄ Progressors - This is your group if you're tracking with the concepts, but seek opportunities to further **enhance your understanding and skills** - we provide additional exercises and challenges to help you solidify your understanding of the material and build your skills.
3. üèÜ Prodigies - If you're finished with all the course content in a flash and are **excelling beyond** what the course requires, and need extra practice to challenge yourself - we provide advanced content and projects to help you push your skills to the next level.

To access the content, navigate to the corresponding weekly topic folder and find the content that is most appropriate for where you are. We encourage you to take advantage of all the resources available to you, regardless of your current level of understanding.

Please note that the content provided in this repository is meant to supplement, not replace, the material covered in your SWE apprenticeship curriculum. It is essential that you continue engaging with the material covered in your course.

If you have any questions or feedback, please ask your coach. We hope that this resource helps you achieve success in your SWE course work!

## Running Tests
There are automated coding challenges in this repository. You may run them locally, but we will not learn how to use git until Week 3. For now, you can edit your code and run the tests by forking [The Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-fxg5uf?file=package.json,README.md)
